# Portfolio Build
    This website will be in constant construction as I go through bootcamp learning new code languages

# Application:
   Through second week of boot camp, We as a class learned about advanced CSS.  This was a very complex task, with so much coming at you  at once.  Kinda like trying to take a drink from a firehose.
  
   This portfolio used many of the different applications of CSS such as Flexbox, Pseudo Elements, Media queries, box styling and typography.
  
   Even though I didn't use all the applications that CSS has to offer, I cant wait to see what future brings .
  
   Therefore, please help me in my journey! If you see anything I can clean up or have suggestions, just drop me an email.
  
   Until then I will keep adding to this portfolio.
